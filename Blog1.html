    <h1>  My Nimcet Journey  </h1>
    <p>
        Hello guys! My name is Shilpi and i welcome you all to my very first blog. The best part about this blog is that,
        it is released on a Blog page  which is created by me.
        In this blog you all are going to read about my nimcet journey , how i studied , what my state of mind by then was, which book i followed
        and what this Nimcet exam actually is.
        <p>
            So Nimcet exam is basically an entrance test through which a student can get into any Nit college for their masters in computer applications.
            It consists of 4 sections - Maths, Reasoning, English and Computer Awareness. Maths here is the deciding key . It alone consists 60% of the paper, if you excel maths you can easily crack this xam.
            Sad part about this exam is very less people are aware of this exam. In 2021 only 11k approx students appeared for the paper.
        </p>
        <p> I heard about this exam in my first year of BCA though one of my well-wisher, but that time i didn't take it so seriously till my 3rd year of BCA.
            Actually i was not at all in a mood to give this exam , i was thinking to move to another field. But again this wave of nimcet exam , nit colleges like trichy, suratkhal, allahabad etc my classmates keep discussing
            about it, half of my classmates were preparing for it. Then i talked to two of my friends. i would love to mention their names here 
            One is Ayush Anand and other is Vishal Gaurav. Ayush Anand is really such a sweet boy you barely can find a boy like him, among we three friends me vishal and ayush, Ayush is our motivational guru.

          <h4>My Strategy</h4>
          I started my preparation from jan end  and that time I had 4 months for the paper as exam held in mid may.
          In starting i was following unacademy for maths, but as time passed i realised studying from unacademy wasn't helping me in my prep, I couldn't able to crack questions 
          So after 1 month studying from unacademy I move on to Amit Sir, I stick to that teacher for concept revision
          and start solving R D Sharma theory book which i used to solve  in my 12th, for question practice.
          For reasoning i didnt go for any book. I solved PYQ's for it. 
          For computer I watched videos of Pratik Sir which is free available on Youtube.
          For english I didnt do anything. <br>
          When Talk abt time, i didn't watch time my instict tells me how much i have to study, when i feel 'aur hna chahiye',i keep studying and when i feel 'ye ho jayega', i don't feel to study even for a minute.
          So there is no time boundation, u see your current status and how much you need to reach to desired destination, study according to that but consistency is must.
          <h4>Difficulties</h4>
          I don't call it difficulty but 'AISH' when corona hits, my exam got postphoned and there was no notice for the next date.  Like most students i also lost my consistency.
          More than a month I hadn't touched my books, my insticts were constantly says 'Aishe naa ho paayega Shilpi '.  So after complete my  one precious month i again came in form and for last 2 months i studied with same seriousnesss as in starting and able to crack this exam. I remember before one week of exam , I was studying like hell and it was necessary for me to compensate my that 1 month wastage.
          Completing my computer section as per exam syllabus is still close my heart. I had alloted time for computer from 12-3 am and I kept following this routine for more than 1 week . But unfortunately computer section wasn't like as I thought it will come based on previous year analysis. But it's ok my maths went well more than i had expected.  Yaay :D
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>More i was lucky too in this exam may be because of my mother blessings</p>
        <p>Also got to know what cracking of exam means for a parent . So give exam , crack that exam and give your parents happiness. :)</p>
